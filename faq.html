      <p><b>Do I need to have any prior experience with coding/programming to participate?</b></p>
      <li>No, our plan for this year is to learn together in order to be competitive for next year.</li>
      <p><b>What kind of hardware do I need?</b></p>
      <li>If you can run Discord, your computer should be fine. It would help to have some sort of unix-like os to work with (this means Linux, macOS, BSD, WSL etc.) in so you can use the same scripts and commands as we do. If you need any help with this, ask the admins.</li>

      <li>According to Rasmussen College: "A hackathon is an event, usually hosted by a tech company or organization, where programmers get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project. The participants work rapidly and often work without sleep to achieve their task, as the events generally only last 24 hours or take place over a weekend." Usually, the involve penetration or completion of some challege, or develop a new solution to a problem laid out by the oraganizers. These soultions are judged by a panel of judges, and participants are given prizes based on their performance.</li>
      <p><b>Who is this club for?</b></p>
      <li>Our aim when creating this club was to ensure that students interested in software development had a club in which they were well represented and could participate. Of course, we also want to compete in hackathons.</li>

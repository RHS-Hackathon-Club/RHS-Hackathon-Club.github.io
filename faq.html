    <ul>
      <p><b>Do I need to have any prior experience with coding/programming to participate?</b></p>
      <li>Not really, however it's helpful to have the drive to learn stuff outside of the club meetings. We can help guide you.</li>
      <p><b>What kind of hardware do I need?</b></p>
      <li>For yourself, pretty much anything you can run Google Docs on. The exception being chromebooks, you'll want to pull your hair out if you tried to code on one of those without experience or patience. If we work with more specialized hardware then it will be from the club's budget or donations.</li>
      <p><b>What is a Hackathon?</b></p>
      <li>An event hosted by a tech company, school, or organization. Participants are given 24 hours to make some sort of project that is able to solve a problem of the judge's choosing. These judges will eventually look at what you made and award prizes based on merit. There will also be booths hosted by tech companies to teach their paid software development products, which usually takes care of funding for these events. The main utility that comes from participation is the fun factor, meeting new people and maybe the serotonin hit that comes from potentially earning a prize.</li>
      <p><b>Who is this club for?</b></p>
      <li>Anyone who cares enough to participate and is willing to enjoy themselves working on software with other people</li>

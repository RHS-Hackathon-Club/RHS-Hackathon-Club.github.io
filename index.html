    <hr>
    <p>We're a group of students at Robbinsville High School interested in Technology who will soon compete in Hackathon Competitons. As we are stuck at home this year, 2020-21 will be focused on learning the skills needed in order to participate in future hackathons both virtual and in-person. This means you DO NOT need any prior knowledge.</p>
    <p>Most questions can be answered in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a>. If you need to ask a targeted question, or a question that wasn't answered in the FAQ, you can contact any one of the admins.</p>

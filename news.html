	<h2>Updates to the Club</h2>
	<h3>2.26.21</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>It's become clear to the club members and leadership that membership and attendance have been falling steadily 
	since operations started up in September. We can attribute this to a number of factors including the continuation of
	virtual school, low exposure, lack of interest given our current meeting model among other things. The executives
	have concluded that if we continue in this trajectory, the club cannot live to see the end of 2021. It is for this
	reason that we have decided to bring some sweeping changes to how the club will be managed and run in the future.</p>
	
	<h4>Changes to Meeting Structure</h4>
	<p>When the club's design was in it's infancy during the 2019-20 school year, it was intended that we would meet in
	person to learn various concepts together. Since then, we've experienced a pandemic which threw a whole wrench into
	that idea. So far, all we've done is adapt that initially dated idea to Discord, which obviously doesn't yield the
	same participation and interest as conducting meetings in person would. In light of this, the club will be taking a
	new direction in terms of meeting structure. Instead of teaching, the meetings will be used as a showcase of progress
	made outside of the club time. The showcase will include demos, explanations, presentations and more. The idea is that
	club members can pick up a project and work on it outside of the club, then present progress during the meetings. This
	provides a great transition for when we come back in person, promotes productivity and should yield a lot more
	engagement than our current instruction based model. All of the learning is going to come as a result of the learning
	while doing process instead. We wanted this club to be fun, not work, and this is the best way to realize that.</p>

	<h4>What About Hackathons?</h4>
	<p>We're called the hackathon club since we wanted to attend hacakthons as a group, but obviously the pandemic threw a
	wrench into that idea too. We've compensated with the mini hackathons and signing up for HackPHS and competing, but
	it has become clear that just doing those things isn't enough to sustain the club. We've appointed a new person to
	sign up for hackathons on behalf of the club and hopefully this should streamline the process of competeing in the
	in more events in the near future. This should also be a partial fix to the slowing of new members joining the club
	and the lack of exposure we have as of now. CTF challenges will also be promoted during the club meeting time.</p>

	<h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
	<p>We've gone over a lot of changes here, and there are many more to come, we want this club to stay afloat after
	2022 for others to enjoy. We came in with high ambitions, and we're not ready to give up on them yet. You can do your
	part in improving the club by providing feedback to any of the executives at any time. We'd also like you to fill out
	the form at the bottom of this page so that we can get an idea of what we can change short term. Thanks for reading.</p>
